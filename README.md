# tmdb-movie-fetch-app
Flutter app showcasing a movie catalog with features like favoriting movies, detailed movie information, and categorized exploration. Utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API for fetching movie data. Built with Flutter and GetX state management.
The Flutter Movie and Shows App features a dynamic interface with a responsive grid layout, allowing users to explore and mark their favorite movies. Utilizing GetX for efficient state management, the app seamlessly navigates between home, favorites, categories, and channels screens. A visually engaging splash screen with an animated movie icon precedes the app, enhancing the user experience. The app retrieves movie data from "The Movie Database (TMDb)" API using an asynchronous network request. The MovieService class handles the API communication, sending a request to TMDb's movie discovery endpoint. The response, containing a list of movies in JSON format, is then parsed and converted into a list of Movie objects. This approach ensures real-time and up-to-date movie information within the app.
